"AMD Ryzen 7000X3D Series processors with AMD 3D V-Cache.", "Excellent CPU which includes Radeon internal video graphics. I am not a gamer and I use the internal graphics because graphics cards are very expensive. This works very well for surfing the net and playing Solitaire. I run dual monitors on my MSI B650 Tomahawk which supports HDMI and Displayport. The 8700X3D runs both effortless and with good speed. This CPU can be run at 105w or 65w. I run mine at 65w because I want the power savings. For my modest use the 8700X3D runs around 25-30 watts all the time.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"
"", "Put this CPU in a brand new PC build. It runs very power-efficient, using only ~60watts (in my setup) under gaming loads. With the heat transfer properties of the cover, even a mid-tier air cooler can keep up with the transfer pace and keep this CPU cool. With the increased cache, it is hard to top this CPU for gaming performance. This is top-of-the-line for gaming, where all 8 cores have access to this "3D V-Cache"; which is essentially just increasing the amounts of L3 cache available to the CPU; which also has the increased benefit of reducing reliance on the speed of your RAM. Price-wise, this CPU consistently has been going for roughly the same price as the highest end bulldozer CPUs went for, while delivering top-tier performance, as opposed to bottom-tier. For gaming workloads, I do not think there is really any better option. This is the CPU you want to pair with the best gaming GPUs.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"
"", "Absolutely smokes anything else I've had like it's standing still. Any unoptimized game that just releases still feels stable due to the L3 cache and it's not exactly a slacker when it comes to work loads either, but it's not the fastest. For a purely gaming PC this or the new Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best price to performance currently standing. Very power efficient and if they ever add a new AM5 you can upgrade the CPU without needing a new mobo and ram.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"
"", "I started off the jump to the 5th generation boards with an i9-13900k and an ASUS z790E for two weeks. Swapped to an i9-14900KF and the board and cpu started failing on me. Went through a lot more hell.Gave up and returned everything and switched to AM5 with a 7800x3D cpu and a ASROCK B650 Steel Legend WiFi board. The installation was fast and swiftless after updating the bios through flash back. Everything works out the box. The temps are fantastic. Low power usage even, unlike the i9’s consuming 250-300 watts on certain games with stock settings. Everything feels smooth. And best of all, I wasn’t sold a fake CPU like Best Buy store number 555 did to me with an i9-14900K brand new in the box. My condolences to those who have been sold a tampered product from when I read the one star reviews here. I know your pain.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"
"", "I'm writing this review with the new 9000 series right around the corner, to make sure that people still consider the Ryzen 7 7800X3D as a viable upgrade to their gaming systems. I'm coming from a previous system of a Ryzen 5 5600X and an RTX 4080 Super, which, while playable, was one where I could clearly tell that my RTX 4080 Super couldn't properly stretch its legs. I see people mention the fast processing power of the 7800X3D, and while this is true (I can't state enough just how much snappier my system feels in comparison to the 5600X even when not playing games), I'd also like to mention what made the 7800X3D such a great upgrade for me. In many of my games, while, again, I had a playable experience with the 5600X, in areas with heavy NPCs or geometry, my system really started to struggle, with a strong sense of choppiness and stutter, in a way where I would dread going to those areas, sticking to more open areas in games, instead. With the 7800X3D, that fear is a thing of the past, and I believe that in addition to its sheer processing power, that's also due to the much more consistent 1% and 0.1% fps lows that I experience with the 7800X3D. It's obviously not something you can point to and go "wow, look at all the fps I'm getting!", like we gamers like to do. But it is something that has an immediate noticeable effect in games. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 fully maxed out (especially in the new Dogtown area) simply feel so much smoother, and the same goes for Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC area, that is incredibly heavy with notably complex architecture geometry. So, while some maybe might argue that there was no point in me upgrading with the 9000 series right around the corner, or that I could have just gotten a 5800X3D instead, I'd say this. While yes, I could have gotten a 5800X3D, I figured at the very least that I should upgrade to the new platform, and get all of the benefits of PCIE 4.0 (I was previously on a much older system), and DDR5 RAM guaranteed in the future, as well as a viable upgrade path. Which brings me to my next point. Even though the 9000 series will be arriving soon, if you're like me, and you enjoy enthusiast 1440p gaming while still preferring to upgrade every other generation (it just makes the most sense to me financially), I plan on sticking with my 7800X3D until the series after 9000 is fully released. By that time, I'll likely be ready for the RTX 6000 series, and a proper CPU upgrade right alongside it. The uplift it has brought my system is just fantastic, and I just can't see the 7800X3D being outdone before that time! Many games I'm looking forward to in the farther future, like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, don't currently recommend anything close to it. I don't believe it would be a mistake to purchase the 7800X3D right now, unless you're absolutely dying to be on the cutting edge of the new generation of tech. But that's also just my feeling and opinion; of course, I'm sure Hardware Unboxed and the like will have their own thorough educated reviews comparing what we have available, when all is said and done. Personally, I just didn't want to wait through any potential growing pains with the 9000 series that have been all ironed out here already, and my experience with the games I enjoy currently was frustrating enough that I also didn't want to wait for the 9000 series X3D variants to be released, as well. I genuinely wanted improvements now, so the purchase was worth it for me! As far as my own experience with Amazon, no problems here. I had to give a password to the delivery driver in-person before they would hand over the package, which I deeply appreciated. When you're dealing with things this expensive, I believe it should be a must. It arrived in its own original packaging, and when paired with my Scythe Mugen 6 Dual Fan cooler, and the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX motherboard, it has been running like a dream, both in the games I've mentioned, as well as with general work and recreation. I just wanted to give my thoughts and opinion in case anyone is on the fence about purchasing at this time like I was. Hopefully you found this review helpful!", "5.0 out of 5 stars"

"", "So currently as the 9800x3D is not released yet... the 7800x3D is the best CPU on the market. I've had no issues with it and I noticed IMMEDIATELY the difference it made when I started playing video games. Everything is smooth and quick. This also has graphics built into it... good enough to run some games. How it won't replace a GPU but the fact that it has something build in that can get you through a pinch is amazing. Air cooling works well with it also so you can save money and avoid an AIO.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Amazon Customer", "So, I'm building a new gaming rig, right? And I'm like, "What's the latest and greatest out there that won't make my wallet cry?" Enter the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Now, I’m not one to drool over tech specs, but this thing has some serious hype. I figured, why not give it a go? First off, this CPU is a beast. I slapped this bad boy in my setup, and it’s like it came alive. It's like I suddenly had a gaming butler who anticipates my every need. Seriously, I’ve never seen games load this fast. It’s almost like the CPU is saying, "Here you go, sir, enjoy your game," with a posh British accent. And boy, does it play—smooth, no hiccups, just pure, unadulterated gaming bliss. But let’s talk cooling. You know how some people say they "run hot"? Well, this CPU runs hot like it's training for a marathon in the Sahara. If you don't have good airflow in your case, you're basically creating a mini volcano in your room. I had to crank up my cooling system to keep it from overheating. It's like the CPU is trying to start a BBQ in there. I gotta say, it’s still worth every penny. This thing outperforms CPUs that cost twice as much. It’s like buying a sports car at sedan prices. But make sure you update your BIOS, especially if you're rocking an ASUS motherboard, or you're in for a world of trouble. In the end, this CPU is the best bang for your buck, especially if you’re into gaming. Just be ready to invest in some serious cooling. Overall, I'd give it a solid 5 stars. It's powerful, fast, and efficient—just what you need to keep your gaming sessions smooth and enjoyable. Plus, you get to flex on your friends who spent more on their fancy Intel setups.", "5.0 out of 5 stars"
